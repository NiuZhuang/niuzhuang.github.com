Here is the dropdown list:
<selection>
 <option>Hello, world</option>
 <option>Ruby on Rails</option>
 <option>Node.js</option>
 <option>Golang</option>
 <option>ASP.NET MVC</option>
</selection>

I just want to figure out what the dropdown is like on Android and iOS 7.
Later I will post the screenshots.
